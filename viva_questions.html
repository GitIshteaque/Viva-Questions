          <li>How do you create a company in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">To create a company, select 'Create Company' from the Company Info menu, then enter details such as company name, address, financial year, and statutory features. This process sets up a new environment for managing all your business accounts, ledgers, and transactions in Tally, and you can later modify these details as needed.</span></li>
          <li>What is a ledger?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A ledger is an account head in Tally where all transactions of a particular type (such as cash, sales, or expenses) are recorded. Ledgers help organize and track financial data for reporting and analysis, and each ledger belongs to a group (like Assets, Liabilities, Income, or Expenses) for better classification and control.</span></li>
          <li>What is a voucher in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A voucher is a document or entry in Tally used to record a specific financial transaction, such as payments, receipts, sales, or purchases. Each voucher type corresponds to a different kind of business activity, and vouchers ensure that all transactions are properly documented and can be easily retrieved for auditing or reporting.</span></li>
          <li>Name different types of vouchers in Tally.<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Common voucher types include Payment, Receipt, Contra, Journal, Sales, Purchase, Debit Note, and Credit Note. Each type is used for a specific transaction and helps maintain accurate records. For example, Payment vouchers are for outgoing payments, while Receipt vouchers are for incoming funds.</span></li>
          <li>How do you enable GST in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Press F11 to open Company Features, then enable Goods and Services Tax (GST). Enter GST details such as registration type, GSTIN, and tax rates. This makes Tally ready for GST-compliant accounting, invoicing, and returns, and allows you to generate GST reports and file returns directly from the software.</span></li>
          <li>What is a cost centre?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A cost centre is a unit, department, or location within an organization to which costs are allocated for tracking and analysis. In Tally, cost centres help monitor expenses and profitability for different business segments, projects, or branches, enabling better financial control and decision-making.</span></li>
          <li>What is a cost category?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A cost category is a way to group cost centres into different classifications, allowing for parallel tracking of costs. This is useful for businesses that want to analyze costs by multiple dimensions, such as projects and departments, and helps in detailed cost analysis and reporting.</span></li>
          <li>How do you create a ledger under a group?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Go to Accounts Info ‚Üí Ledgers ‚Üí Create, select the appropriate group (like Sundry Debtors or Expenses), and enter the ledger details. Grouping ledgers helps organize accounts for better reporting, control, and compliance with accounting standards.</span></li>
          <li>What is the shortcut to create a ledger during voucher entry?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Press Alt + C while entering a voucher to quickly create a new ledger without leaving the voucher screen. This saves time, streamlines data entry, and ensures that all necessary ledgers are available during transaction recording.</span></li>
          <li>How do you view the Day Book in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Go to Gateway of Tally ‚Üí Display ‚Üí Day Book, or simply press F2. The Day Book shows all vouchers entered on a particular day, helping you review, verify, and audit daily transactions efficiently.</span></li>
          <li>What is the use of F11 in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">F11 opens the Company Features menu, where you can enable or configure features like inventory, taxation, payroll, and more. It customizes Tally to suit your business needs and ensures that only relevant modules are active for your company.</span></li>
          <li>How do you shut a company in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Press Alt + F1 to shut the currently open company. This closes the company data and returns you to the company selection screen, ensuring data security and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.</span></li>
          <li>What is the shortcut to duplicate a voucher?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Press Alt + 2 on a voucher to duplicate it. This is useful for quickly creating similar entries without re-entering all details, saving time and reducing errors in repetitive transactions.</span></li>
          <li>How do you print a report in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">On any report screen, press Alt + P to open the print menu. You can customize print settings, select the printer, and generate hard copies of reports for records, sharing, or compliance purposes.</span></li>
          <li>What is the use of Alt+C in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Alt + C allows you to create a new ledger, group, or item instantly while entering data, making the workflow faster and more flexible. This feature is especially helpful when you need to add new accounts on the fly during voucher entry.</span></li>
          <li>How do you export data from Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Press Alt + E on a report to export data in formats like Excel, PDF, or XML. Exporting helps in sharing, analysis, backup, and integration with other software or compliance systems.</span></li>
          <li>What is the difference between a group and a ledger?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A group is a collection of similar ledgers (like all expense accounts), while a ledger is an individual account. Groups help organize ledgers for better reporting, control, and compliance, whereas ledgers record specific transactions.</span></li>
          <li>How do you view the balance sheet in Tally?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Go to Gateway of Tally ‚Üí Balance Sheet or press Ctrl + B. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity at a given date, helping you assess the financial position of the business.</span></li>

MS Access is widely used for small to medium-sized databases and integrates well with other Microsoft Office applications.</span></li>
          <li>What is a table in MS Access?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A table in MS Access is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field. Tables are the foundation for storing all data in a database, and each table can be related to others for complex data management.</span></li>
          <li>What is a primary key?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two records are identical and helps establish relationships between tables for data integrity. Primary keys are essential for indexing and fast data retrieval.</span></li>
          <li>What is a foreign key?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table. It is used to create relationships and maintain referential integrity between tables, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate across the database.</span></li>
          <li>What is a query?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A query is a request for information from a database.

Queries can be saved and reused for regular data tasks.</span></li>
          <li>What is a form in MS Access?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A form is a user-friendly interface in MS Access that allows users to enter, view, or edit data in tables. Forms can include controls like text boxes, buttons, and combo boxes for better data management, and they help ensure data is entered accurately and efficiently.</span></li>
          <li>What is a report in MS Access?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A report is a formatted output of data from tables or queries, designed for printing or sharing. Reports help present data in a structured and visually appealing way for analysis or record-keeping, and can include charts, summaries, and calculations.</span></li>
          <li>How do you create a relationship between tables?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">In MS Access, go to Database Tools ‚Üí Relationships, then drag and drop fields (usually primary and foreign keys) between tables to establish connections. This helps maintain data consistency, enables relational queries, and enforces referential integrity.</span></li>
          <li>What is normalization?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them, which helps in efficient data storage and retrieval.</span></li>
          <li>What is a data type?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A data type specifies the kind of data a field can hold, such as text, number, date, or currency. Choosing the correct data type ensures data is stored and processed correctly in the database, and helps prevent errors during data entry and analysis.</span></li>
          <li>What is a combo box in a form?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A combo box is a drop-down list in a form that allows users to select a value from predefined options. It improves data entry accuracy, user experience, and helps standardize the data entered into the database.</span></li>
          <li>How do you set a primary key in MS Access?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">In table design view, select the field you want as the primary key and click the key icon. This ensures each record is unique, helps with table relationships, and improves data retrieval speed.</span></li>
          <li>What is referential integrity?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Referential integrity is a set of rules that ensures relationships between tables remain consistent. It prevents orphan records, maintains data accuracy across related tables, and enforces valid data entry in relational databases.</span></li>
          <li>What is the difference between a form and a report?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">A form is used for data entry and editing, providing an interactive interface, while a report is used for presenting and printing data in a structured format. Both are essential for managing and sharing database information, but serve different purposes in the workflow.</span></li>
          <li>How do you import data into MS Access?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">Use the External Data tab and select the appropriate import option (Excel, CSV, etc.). Follow the prompts to map fields and import data into your tables, making it easy to bring in data from other sources.</span></li>
          <li>What is SQL?<br><span class="text-base italic text-gray-700">SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate databases. In MS Access, SQL is used behind the scenes for queries and data operations, allowing for powerful data analysis and automation.</span></li>
